Boiler-Calculator-2
===================

The successor to http://calculator.towerofawesome.org

The main goal is to increase userfriendlyness by providing an interface similar to the in-game one instead of the web-form that is the current calculator.

This is achieved through heavy use of javascript.

This is not meant to replace the previous calculator completely. It will remain and keep being supported as an alternative for people who wont or can't use javascript, which will obviously be a requirement for the new version.
